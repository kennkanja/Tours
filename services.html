                    <br>
                    <p>What once was a remote railway outpost has become the largest city between Johannesburg
                         and Cairo and is Kenya's capital city and the world's safari capital. 
                         It has long been the commercial centre of Eastern Africa and one of 
                         the world's cross-roads with its international airport servicing most
                          of the world's airlines.</p>
                    
                          <p>Kenya's capital city has risen in a single century from a brackish
                             uninhabited swampland to a thriving modern capital. Nairobi is a 
                             city that never seems to sleep. The entire town has a boundless energy, 
                             and is a thriving place where all of human life can be found. 
                             This is a place of great contrasts where race, tribe and origin all become 
                             facets of a unique Nairobi character.</p>
